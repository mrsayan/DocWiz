## **DocWiz** 

An automatic document generator for generating customizable Machine Learning risk management documents by just 

- uploading your models and validation dataset 
- writing very bare minimum about the model performance and general information
- Watch different charts and choose which are required to export 
- Using chatGPT API `DocWiz` can generate professional reports from just bare minimum information 
- Get your Documentation with customizable templates within seconds

### **Future Scopes and Roadmap**

**`Web`**

- [ ] Building a dedicated backend using FastAPI / Flask 
- [ ] Better UI with React/Angular 

**`ML/MLOps`**

- [ ] Tracking data and model drift and visualization 
- [ ] Using XAI (Explainable AI) for providing better root cause analysis 
- [ ] Using automatics CI/CD for generating major data/model version control information on the doc. 
- [ ] Also showing other information metric required for deployement including CPU Usages, disk usage and latency
