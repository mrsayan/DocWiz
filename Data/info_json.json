    "overview": "The Credit Line Decrease (CLD) model is used to identify high risks accounts with\nthe objective to mitigate potential losses by decreasing their credit limit. The\nmodel will be used on all the RRB credit card customers. ",
    "data_prep": "The model has been developed using the extracts from the Card Master File\n(CMF). Given that the development of the model was priority based for the\nbusiness based on the impact analysis of quick model developed earlier, a\nlimited set of features were used from a previous model (APD model).",
    "model_name": "XGBoost",
    "model_methadology": "XGBoost and Logistic Regression are two techniques used for creating the model\nalong with GBM trees. The final model is built using XGBoost and this is\ndetermined based on the performance benefits observed in using XGBoost.",
    "assumptions": "The model has been built on both internal as well as external data. The external\ncredit bureau data is received monthly through a batch process for the Existing\nCard Members (ECM). In addition, the model leverages daily data \u2013 daily\nbureau (in addition to batch bureau), daily triggers and a few daily on-us\nattributes \u2013 to allow the identification of high risk accounts before they utilize the\nremaining open-to-buy amount.",
    "conclusion": "The model Risk Score shows incremental model performance compared to other\nbenchmarks. While there is no direct benchmark available for the CLD model\nsince it\u2019s a bespoke score, it is still compared to the other scores, since they are\nbeing used in the current CLD policy. "
