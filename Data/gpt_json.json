    "overview": "\n\nThe Credit Line Decrease (CLD) model is a tool used to identify credit card accounts that have a high risk of default or potential losses. The CLD model will be used to reduce the credit limit of these accounts in order to mitigate potential losses. This model will be applied to all RRB credit card customers.",
    "data_prep": "\n\n1. Data Acquisition: The first step in data preparation is to acquire the data from the Card Master File (CMF). This includes collecting the necessary information from the CMF such as customer\u2019s credit card number, card type, and other relevant data.\n\n2. Data Cleaning: Data cleaning is the process of identifying and fixing incorrect, incomplete, or irrelevant data. This includes removing outliers, normalizing data, and filling in missing values.\n\n3. Feature Selection: Feature selection is the process of selecting the most important features from the data set to be used in the model. This can be done by using methods such as correlation analysis, information gain, and wrapper methods.\n\n4. Data Splitting: Data splitting is the process of dividing the data set into a training set, which is used to build the model, and a test set, which is used to evaluate the performance of the model.\n\n5. Model Training: Model training is the process of building the predictive model using the training data set. This can be done by using various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.\n\n6. Model Evaluation: Model evaluation is the process of assessing the performance of the model using the test data set. This can be done by measuring metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.",
    "model_name": "XGBoost",
    "model_methadology": " and Logistic Regression are two different machine learning algorithms used to create predictive models. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) are another type of algorithm that is sometimes used to build predictive models. XGBoost is a modified version of GBM that is known to outperform traditional GBM models and is often used as the final model due to its improved performance. Therefore, the final model is built using XGBoost because it provides the best performance benefits.",
    "assumptions": "\n\nThis assumption states that the model being built relies on both internal (from the company) and external (from outside sources) data. The external credit bureau data is sent to the company monthly in batches for existing card members, while the company also uses daily data such as daily bureau, triggers and on-us attributes to identify high-risk accounts before they use their remaining open-to-buy amount.",
    "conclusion": "\n\nThis reason for assumptions is that the CLD model is being compared to the other scores that are being used in the current CLD policy. In order to develop the CLD model, a limited set of features were used from the previous APD model. XGBoost and Logistic Regression were used to develop the model, with XGBoost being chosen due to its performance benefits. The model has been built using both internal and external data, with the external credit bureau data received monthly and the daily data being used to identify high risk accounts."
